 Standard automatic speech recognizers output unstructured streams words,0
" They neither perform proper segmentation output sentences, predict punctuation symbols",0
" The unavailable punctuations sentence boundaries transcribed speech texts create barriers many subsequent processing tasks, summarization, information extraction, question answering machine translation",0
" Thus, segmentation long texts necessary many real applications",0
" For example, speech-to-speech translation, continuously transcribed speech texts need segmented fed subsequent machine translation systems (Takezawa et al",0
", 1998; Nakamura, 2009)",0
" This current machine translation (MT) systems perform translation sentence level, various models used MT trained segmented sentences many algorithms inside MT exponential complexity regard length inputs",0
 The punctuation prediction problem attracted research interest speech processing community natural language processing community,0
" Most previous work primarily exploits local features statistical models lexicons, prosodic cues hidden event language model (HELM) (Liu et al",0
", 2005; Matusov et al",0
", 2006; Huang Zweig, 2002; Stolcke Shriberg, 1996)",0
 The word-level models integrating local features narrow views input could achieve satisfied performance due limited context information access (Favre et al,0
", 2008)",0
" Naturally, global contexts required model punctuation prediction, especially long-range dependencies",0
" For instance, English question sentences, ending question mark long-range dependent initial phrases (Lu Ng, 2010), “could you” Figure 1",0
 There work trying incorporate syntactic features broaden view hypotheses punctuation prediction models (Roark et al,0
", 2006; Favre et al",0
", 2008)",0
" In methods, punctuation prediction treated separated post-procedure parsing, may suffer problem error propagation",0
" In addition, approaches able incrementally process inputs efficient long inputs, especially cases long transcribed speech texts presentations number streaming words could larger hundreds thousands",0
" In paper, propose jointly performing punctuation prediction transition-based dependency parsing transcribed speech text",0
" When transition-based parsing consumes stream words left right shift-reduce decoding algorithm, punctuation symbols predicted word based contexts parsing tree",0
 Two models proposed cause punctuation prediction interact transition actions parsing,0
 One conduct transition actions parsing followed punctuation predictions cascaded way,0
" The associate conventional transition actions parsing punctuation perditions, predicted punctuations directly inferred parsing tree",0
 Our models linear complexity capable handling streams words length,0
" In addition, computation models use rich set syntactic features, improve complicated punctuation predictions global view, especially long range dependencies",0
 Figure 1 shows example parsing helps punctuation prediction transcribed speech text,0
" As illustrated Figure 1(b), two commas predicted preceding words act adverbial modifiers (advmod) parsing",0
 The period word “menu” predicted parsing adverbial clause modifier (advcl) completed,0
" The question mark end input determined direct object modifier (dobj) identified, together long range clue auxiliary word occurs nominal subject (nsubj)",0
" Eventually, two segmentations formed according punctuation prediction results, shown Figure 1(c)",0
" The training data used models adapted Treebank data excluding punctuations keeping punctuation contexts, simulate unavailable annotated transcribed speech texts",0
" In decoding, beam search used get optimal punctuation prediction results",0

 Sentence boundary detection punctuation prediction extensively studied speech processing field attracted research interest natural language processing field well,0
 Most previous work exploits local features task,0
" Kim Woodland (2001), Huang Zweig (2002), Christensen et al",0
" (2001), Liu et al",0
" (2005) integrate prosodic features (pitch, pause duration, etc",0
") lexical features (words, n-grams, etc",0
") predict punctuation symbols speech recognition, Huang Zweig (2002) uses maximum entropy model, Christensen et al",0
" (2001) focus finite state multi-layer perceptron methods, Liu et al",0
 (2005) uses conditional random fields,0
" However, scenarios prosodic cues available due inaccessible original raw speech waveforms",0
 Matusov et al,0
 (2006) integrate segmentation features log-linear model statistical machine translation (SMT) framework improve translation performance translating transcribed speech texts,0
 Lu Ng (2010) uses dynamic conditional random fields perform sentence boundary sentence type prediction,0
 They achieved promising results English Chinese transcribed speech texts,0
" The work exploits local features, limited capturing long range dependencies punctuation prediction",0
" It natural incorporate global knowledge, syntactic information, improve punctuation prediction performance",0
 Roark et al,0
 (2006) use rich set non-local features including parser scores re-rank full segmentations,0
 Favre et al,0
 (2008) integrate syntactic information PCFG parser log-linear combine local features sentence segmentation,0
" The punctuation prediction works performed post-procedure step parsing, parse tree needs built advance",0
" As parsing stream words transcribed speech text exponentially complex, approaches feasible short input processing",0
" Unlike works, incorporate punctuation prediction parsing process left right input without length limitations",0
" Numerous dependency parsing algorithms proposed natural language processing community, including transition-based graph-based dependency parsing",0
" Compared graph-based parsing, transition-based parsing offer linear time complexity easily leverage non-local features models (Yamada Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al",0
", 2006b; Zhang Clark, 2008; Huang Sagae, 2010)",0
" Starting work (Zhang Nivre, 2011), paper extend transition-based dependency parsing sentence-level stream words integrate parsing punctuation prediction",0
 Joint POS tagging transition-based dependency parsing studied (Hatori et al,0
", 2011; Bohnet Nivre, 2012)",0
" The improvements reported joint model compared pipeline model Chinese richly inflected languages, shows also makes sense jointly perform punctuation prediction parsing, although two tasks POS tagging punctuation prediction different two ways: 1)",0
 The former usually works well-formed single sentence latter needs process multiple sentences lengthy,0
 POS tags must-have features parsing punctuations not,0
 The parsing quality former sensitive performance entire task latter,0
